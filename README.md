If you would like to help us by proposing a translation then please follow the below steps...<br>
<br>
<b>1.</b> Login to Github using an existing personal account or register as a new user. You must verify your email address with Github before you can propose any changes.<br>
<br>
<b>2.</b> Choose a language to translate. Currently English and Spanish are the only two languages we support, but we will be adding additional languages in the future. Once you have decided which language you would like to work on, navigate to the specific language's locale file via one of the links from the table below. Clicking a link to a locale file will open the file in a new tab so that you may refer back here to continue following these instructions.<br>
<table>
<tr><td><b>Locale File</b></td><td><b>Language</b></td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="https://github.com/triune/taupo-i18n/blob/master/en.json" target="_blank">en.json</a></td><td>ENGLISH</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="https://github.com/triune/taupo-i18n/blob/master/es.json" target="_blank">es.json</a></td><td>SPANISH</td></tr>
</table>
<br>
<b>3.</b> Click the <b>Pencil button</b> above the file viewer to open the editor on this particular locale file. If you cannot click on the pencil button because it is greyed out, you must go back and verify the email address on your Github account first.<br>
<br>
<b>4.</b> Make all suggested string / translation changes in the provided editor.<br>
<br>
In the example string translation below we see one particular string's:<br>
<br>
msg-id: <i>linkFollowUs</i><br>
<i>message</i>: <b>Follow Us</b><br>
<i>context</i>: The text displayed for the Follow Us link.<br>
<br>
If you feel that you can improve upon this translation, edit the word, phrase, or sentence contained in the message body. In this example, the only thing you should change is the message body which is highlighted in bold: <b>Follow Us</b>. You should not change anything else. The context here is provided to help you propose a better translation by offering a little more information on how, where, and what this particular translation (string) is used for.<br>
<br>
<table><tr><td>
"<i>linkFollowUs</i>": {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"<i>message</i>": "<b>Follow Us</b>",<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"<i>context</i>": "The text displayed for the Follow Us link."<br>
}</td></tr></table>
<br>
<b>5.</b> When finished with your proposed translation(s), click the “<b>Propose file change</b>” button below the editor. You can add a description of your changes in the description box if you would like;  this is optional, but recommended.<br>
<br>
<b>6.</b> To complete the process and submit the proposed change(s) upstream, click the "<b>Create Pull Request</b>" button. This is the final step and what sends the changes you are proposing to our developers to incorporate in to our product. Again, adding a description of the changes is optional here, but recommended.<br>
<br>
Happy translating!<br>
